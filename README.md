# Fentanyl-Model
Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Fentanyl in Adults and Pediatric Patients

### Repository Files
Within this repository, we distribute whole-body PBPK models of fentanyl in adults and pediatric patients. The adult PBPK model has been carefully built and evaluated for the prediction of fentanyl and norfentanyl venous and arterial blood plasma concentration-time profiles after intravenous administration in healthy adults as well as adult patients. The model has been used for the assessment of the fentanyl drug-drug interaction with voriconazole.

Subsequently, the adult PBPK model has been scaled to several pediatric populations with mean ages ranging from 32 weeks gestational age in a preterm neonate population up to 2.9 years in a population of young children. The model was used to predict plasma concentration-time profiles as well as individual and mean clearances.

The PK-Sim project files contain simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model development, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, local sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [1].
